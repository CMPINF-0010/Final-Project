For example, as a whole, individuals with masters degrees tend to make more money than those with doctorates. However, we're going to examine which neighborhoods have the highest graduation rates in graduate, undergraduate, and highschool education. Since individuals with masters degrees tend to make more money than those with graduate degrees, we're only going to consider masters degrees for graduate school. "

    "Since some neighborhoods have more people than others, it wouldn't be fair to compare them based on raw counts. So what we're really looking for is the ratios. The way this dataset works is, each number indicates the highest eduation level recieved for that recipient. So if there are 100 entires in \"basic highschool diploma\" for a given neighborhood, then 100 people in that neighborhood who took this school have a highschool education as their highest eduational achievement. If there are 200 people in the neighborhood, this is quite bad. If there are 10,000 people in the neighborhood, this is quite good. This is the motivation behind finding the ratios. \n",

    "### What next?\n",
    "In order to find the best neighborhood, we're going to try to discover which neighborhood corresponds to the largest ratio of people who attained graduate educations as their highest attainment. This will be a good indication of how much of an emphasis this neighborhood puts on education. For further insight, we'll examine undergraduate and highschool. Note that if one neighborhood has 10% of people having HS as their highest attained education and another neighborhood has 5%, this is not enough information to compare the two. This is because there are two reasons why the second neighborhood might have a lower HS graduation ratio: \n",
    "- more people go on to university. This would decrease the HS graduation highest attainment ratio, but it's actually a good thing\n",
    "- more people drop out of high school. This would also decrease the HS graduation highest attainment ratio, but it's a bad thing."

Knowing only that, we'd place Friendship in the lead since it has more college graduates. But, if Strip District has enough Doctorate students, it might be enough to make up for the loss!
